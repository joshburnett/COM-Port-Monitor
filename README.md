# COM Port Monitor

Ever find yourself plugging and unplugging devices into your computer and needing to
know their associated COM ports? I did, so I wrote COM Port Monitor.  All it does is keep track of COM ports that are added or removed, and shows helpful
system notifications to let you know about it.

To use this, you'll need to install the dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then you run
it via `python commonitor.py`. That's it! (Though you might want to create a virtual environment for this tool.)

I'll probably publish this on PyPI at some point to allow installation via pipx, but that's a task
for another day.

Hope you find this helpful!
